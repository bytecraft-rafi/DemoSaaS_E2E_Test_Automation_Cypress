# Test Plan for Demo SaaS Cypress E2E Automation

---

## Overview

This test plan outlines the strategy and scope for automated end-to-end testing of the Demo SaaS platform using Cypress. The focus is on critical user workflows, functional correctness, security, accessibility, and usability to ensure robust, reliable software delivery.

---

## Objectives

* Verify core user interactions (signup, login, ticket management)  
* Validate input forms with both positive and negative test cases  
* Ensure security best practices (XSS prevention, CSRF tokens, secure login)  
* Check accessibility compliance for inclusive user experience  
* Test UI components for correct behavior under various scenarios  
* Automate regression coverage to catch issues early in development cycles  

---

## Test Modules and Rationale

### 1. Signup Form Validation

**Reasoning:**  
User registration is a critical entry point; invalid inputs can cause downstream issues. Tests cover mandatory fields, input format validation (email, password complexity), input sanitization, and boundary cases (length limits).

**Coverage Includes:**  
* Required fields check  
* Email format validation (positive/negative)  
* Password strength requirements  
* Special characters in names  
* Input length limits and whitespace handling  

---

### 2. Signup Accessibility Tests

**Reasoning:**  
Accessibility ensures the app is usable by people with disabilities and meets legal standards. Testing aria-labels, keyboard navigation, error announcement, and color contrast ensures compliance.

**Coverage Includes:**  
* Proper label association with inputs  
* Screen reader announcement of errors  
* Keyboard tab order and focus  
* Basic color contrast for readability  

---

### 3. Signup Security Tests

**Reasoning:**  
Security tests defend against common vulnerabilities during signup, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), secure form submission via HTTPS, password input attributes, URL exposure, and CSRF token presence.

**Coverage Includes:**  
* XSS input rejection  
* HTTPS enforcement  
* Password autocomplete attributes  
* Secure URL handling  
* CSRF token verification  

---

### 4. Login Page Validation

**Reasoning:**  
Login is a gateway to the system. Tests verify input validation, correct error handling, login success with valid credentials, and rejection of invalid or malicious inputs.

**Coverage Includes:**  
* Empty and invalid inputs  
* Case-insensitive email validation  
* SQL injection and XSS attack vectors  
* Password length and special character support  
* Remember me functionality (if applicable)  

---

### 5. Tickets Page (Listing, Search, Filter, Pagination)

**Reasoning:**  
Tickets management is a primary feature; users must reliably view, search, filter, and navigate tickets. Tests ensure UI components behave as expected and data displays correctly.

**Coverage Includes:**  
* Table columns and row content verification  
* Search box filtering by title and ID  
* Status dropdown filtering correctness  
* Pagination controls and navigation  
* Navigation to ticket details and creation  

---

### 6. User Dropdown and Organization Selector

**Reasoning:**  
User profile and organization context switching are important for multi-tenant SaaS. Tests verify dropdown menus, navigation, and correct state management.

**Coverage Includes:**  
* User dropdown options presence  
* Sign out functionality  
* Organization list and selection behavior  
* Organization creation flow  

---

### 7. Settings Page - Organization Members

**Reasoning:**  
Managing organization members is key for permissions and collaboration. Tests verify member listings, role management UI behavior, and adding new members.

**Coverage Includes:**  
* Members list correctness  
* Disabled controls for current user  
* Visibility and accessibility of remove member buttons  
* Add member workflow  

---

## Overall Coverage Strategy

* **Positive scenarios:** Validate expected successful flows and inputs.  
* **Negative scenarios:** Test invalid inputs, error handling, and edge cases.  
* **Security:** Inject malicious inputs and verify defenses.  
* **Accessibility:** Confirm compliance with standards and usability for all users.  
* **UI behavior:** Confirm correct rendering, interactions, and navigation.  

This layered approach minimizes regressions, improves quality, and ensures a secure, user-friendly product.

---

## Execution and Maintenance

* Tests run in CI pipeline on each commit to catch issues early.  
* Modular design allows independent test updates and parallel runs.  
* Custom commands (e.g., `cy.login()`) reduce code duplication.  
* Test data and credentials managed securely with environment variables.  

---

## Summary

The comprehensive coverage across signup, login, tickets, user/org management, and security aspects delivers high confidence in the Demo SaaS application’s reliability, accessibility, and security — key pillars for SaaS success.
